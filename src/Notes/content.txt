Bio from website (has not been updated in years):

The Wandering Word Wizardess
Qatarina Wanders is a former circus performer turned author and self-made businesswoman (with a wee bit of a unicorn obsession). She has edited more than 4,000 books and ghostwritten over 100, including New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestsellers.
​
Her extensive experience in the world of self-publishing and editing spans more than two decades and means she is uniquely placed to help authors achieve their dreams of publication and get their messages out into the world. In addition, she is a single mom, competitive weightlifter, avid reader, and skydiver. 
​
Writing has been a big part of Qatarina’s life for as long as she can remember. As an avid reader, writer, and book editor, she fosters a deep love for the written word. Heck, she has studied seven languages! Qatarina holds both a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in English Literature and Editing with an emphasis in Creative Writing. She is also a Certified Professional Editor (CPE). 
​
After seeing a very real need for traditional-publishing quality in the self-publishing world, Qatarina built Wandering Words Media in 2016 when she decided it was time to settle down from traveling circus life and build something more sustainable.
​
After a ton of trial and error, obscene amounts of coffee, and a relentless determination to crash through walls and repeatedly pick herself back up, Qatarina has now produced hundreds of successful books (of her own and for clients), coached dozens of entrepreneurs, built her business from zero to six figures and beyond, and been featured on numerous media outlets.
​
When she isn’t writing, reading, or editing books, she is likely lifting weights, sweating in a hot yoga class, eating sushi with her daughter, Ora Wanders—a published author at ten years of age—or jumping out of a plane in the Rocky Mountains.
